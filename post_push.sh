# former version will be removed and no longer monitored. As we
# need to support multiple concurrent versions of the same
# container (e.g. EAPs), we also set the project name, which will
# create a separate monitoring project for each version. We need
# to replace the ':' version delimiter to prevent Snyk attempting
# to parse it.
